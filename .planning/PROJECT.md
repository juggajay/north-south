# North South Carpentry — AI-Powered Premium Kit Joinery Platform

## Vision

Transform how Sydney homeowners buy premium joinery through a mobile-first, AI-powered photo-to-CNC pipeline. Customers photograph their space, AI generates styled design renders in seconds, they configure their exact requirements, and the system outputs production-ready specifications.

## Core Problem

Sydney homeowners face a frustrating gap:
- **Budget flat-pack (Kaboodle):** 2.5/5 stars, warping doors, failing hinges
- **Premium custom joinery:** $25k+ budgets, 12-16 week lead times, opaque pricing

The $8k-$25k "missing middle" is underserved. No one provides an intelligent, instant design experience that respects both the customer's time and their desire for quality.

## Solution

An AI-powered platform delivering design consultation quality at self-service speed:

1. **Photo Capture** → Customer photographs their space
2. **AI Magic** → 30-second styled renders of their actual space transformed
3. **Configure** → Real-time 3D configurator with live pricing
4. **Quote** → Submit for manual quote review
5. **Measure** → Professional site measurement (optional)
6. **Build** → CNC-precision manufacturing with progress updates
7. **Deliver** → QR-coded panels with video installation guides

## Core Differentiator

**AI-powered instant visualisation** that competitors cannot match. Kinsman takes weeks for quotes. Custom joiners are inaccessible. We deliver the "wow moment" in 30 seconds.
